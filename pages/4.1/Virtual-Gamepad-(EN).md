[Miroof's Virtual Gamepads](https://github.com/miroof/node-virtual-gamepads) bring a new feature on the recalbox : playing games with your smartphone as controller ! 

You can add up to 4 controllers at a time.

When you connect your recalbox on the network, you just have to get the ip address in the Network Settings. Then connect your smartphone on the same wifi network, open your web browser and type : 
```
http://[the ip of the recalbox]:8080
```
Example : 
```
http://192.168.1.30:8080
```

A new controller has been add in the recalbox. You can either start a game, or go to controller settings to affect this controller to a player.
