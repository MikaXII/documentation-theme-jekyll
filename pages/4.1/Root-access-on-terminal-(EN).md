In order to get a terminal with root access on the recalbox, you have two options : 
- **SSH**  
Connect through ssh to the recalbox, with the following credentials : hostname (recalbox) or ip, 
"root" as login and "recalboxroot" as password.
You can use a terminal from a Mac, [MobaXTerm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) on windows, or a linux Shell.  
Type : 
```ssh root@the_recalbox_ip```
<br><br>
- **Direct access**  
On the frontend screen, press F4 to quit, then ALT+F2 to get a terminal and use the same credentials as above.
