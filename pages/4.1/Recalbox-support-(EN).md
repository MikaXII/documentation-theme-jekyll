Since recalboxOS 4.0.0, a script has been added in order to help the recalbox team solve your problems : `recalbox-support.sh`

This script provides info on

* joytsticks
* kodi
* lirc
* system (lsmod, lsusb, tv service, es_settings, recalbox.conf, recalbox.log,config, df, etc...)  

If you successfully configured WinSCP according to [this wiki page](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-os/wiki/Network-access-with-WinSCP-%28EN%29), Start WinSCP and launch the following command :

`/recalbox/scripts/recalbox-support.sh`   

The script will generate an archive that you can see on the output :

<a href="http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/puttyviawinscp.php" target="_blank" title="See full size picture"><img src="http://www.zimagez.com/miniature/puttyviawinscp.png" alt="See full size picture" /></a>


Please do not use the console mode of winscp, but the putty embedded.    

<a href="http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/winscp03.php" target="_blank" title="See full size picture"><img src="http://www.zimagez.com/miniature/winscp03.png" alt="See full size picture" /></a>    

Get the archive on your PC then upload it somewhere on the net. For example :
* [dl.free.fr](http://dl.free.fr/)
* [zippyshare](http://www.zippyshare.com/)   

Then give the URL to people who asked you the file
