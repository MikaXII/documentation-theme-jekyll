Until the release of 4.1, the only theme available in recalbox will be the official one but you can manually add some with the following steps:

Go to https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-themes and click on the green button (clone or download) then download zip. (or download directly [here](https://github.com/recalbox/recalbox-themes/archive/master.zip))

Extract the archive, and copy the themes you want to use on your recalbox from 
`recalbox-themes-master/themes/` to 
`\\recalbox\share\system\.emulationstation\themes` on your network.  
(`/recalbox/share/system/.emulationstation/themes` on the sd card)  
The `.emulationstation` may be hidden on some OS, so tell your system to show you hidden files.

You can now set your new theme in emulationstation settings and then restart your recalbox.
