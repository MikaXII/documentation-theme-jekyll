Here is the mapping for the Atari ST emulator :

based on a SNES controller :  
A : Right click  
B : Left click  
X : Open the interface (to change disks, etc...)  
Y : Shift  
Select : switch modes between mouse/joystick style  
R1 : Change the mouse sensitivity  
L1 : Opens the virtual keyboard  
L2 : Opens a menu to view the current control mode (mouse / joystick) and the mouse sensitivity adjustment level (a figure that changes the MS: - value that you modify with R1)
